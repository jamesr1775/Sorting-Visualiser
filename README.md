# Sorting Visualiser
The sorting algorithm visualiser.

## UX
### Project Goals
* The goal of this project is to be able to visualise sorting algorithms to be able to understand them better and to know their time and space compexity.
* The website will provide provide the user with a few sorting algorithms to choose from to sort bar chart data on the screen.
* This Website will be:
    * Responsive on multiple platforms such as desktops, tablets and smartphones
    * Provide the user with the sorting algorithm code so that they can try to understand it better along with the visualisation elements.

### User Stories
1. As a potential User I would like to be able to see sorting algorithms sort data in an intuitive way to help understanding.
2. As a new visitor, I would like to seamlessly navigate the website and understand and use the interactive parts easily.
3. As a potential visitor, I want to be able to find the source code so I can see the javascript that was used in a sorting algorithm.
4. As a potential user, I would like to generate data to sort and select a sorting algorithm to sort it.
